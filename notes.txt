- in /user/pages create User.js, import React and add boilerplate implementation to export Users

- add the exact route path
- add a redirect so if a user types anything outside of / it will redirect to main pages
- Add NewPlace.js in /places/pages, import React and add boilerplate implementation to export NewPlace
